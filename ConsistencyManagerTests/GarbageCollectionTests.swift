     This is sort of a wierd test. Basically, I want a sanity check that the garbage collection interval is correct.
     The dispatch_after logic is changing and it's difficult to tell what the units are.
     So, this verifies that the garbage collection interval is in a reasonable range.
     Sadly, one downside of this test is that it takes at least one second to run, but I think it's worth the tradeoff.
